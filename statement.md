# Student Study Tracker - Project Statement

## Problem Statement  
Students often find it challenging to keep track of their study habits and time spent on various subjects, which can lead to ineffective time management and difficulties in identifying areas needing improvement. There is a need for a simple, easy-to-use tool to help students monitor their study sessions and visualize their study patterns.

## Scope of the Project  
This project entails developing a command-line application using basic Python and object-oriented programming concepts. The application will allow multiple users to register and login, track their study sessions by inputting details such as subject, date, duration, and breaks, and generate simple reports summarizing the total study time and subject-wise breakdown. The application will focus on foundational features, without persistent storage or graphical interfaces.

## Target Users  
- School and college students looking for a straightforward way to monitor study habits.  
- Beginners learning Python who want a practical project implementing OOP concepts.  
- Educators seeking a lightweight tool to suggest to students for self-study monitoring.

## High-Level Features  
- User registration and authentication.  
- Adding, viewing, and managing multiple study sessions per user.  
- Calculation and reporting of total study time, accounting for breaks.  
- Study time summarized by individual subjects.  
- Simple, text-based command-line interface with clear menus.  
- Modular and maintainable code structure using classes and separate modules.
